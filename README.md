hi! i'm solis (or starrie) but you can call me kanade too! i use they/it prns and i am a big kanade fan and theorist since 2021. 
i'm a system, so be cautious. headmates may front without telling you. im Autistic shocker. im librafluid and pronounfluid, and my main interests are kanade & pjsk & vocaseries & touhou. i also focus on uma musume, mwd, but not as much.

my main ponies are usually kanade, so.. it's pretty rare to see me with anything that isn't kanade. 
i like to interact with pjsklings!! but mainly n25, i love polycord (and knmz but shh)
or, in general, i like to interact with people who share the same hyperfixation i have. please interact with me, i dont bite! (i am not a conversation starter. i prefer people talk to me first.)
i am intimidated (sorry i couldnt find a better word) by people i dont know that c+h with me. if you are oomf/pjskling its ok! niigo cosplayers...youre always free to...haha.. am i good at flirting guys
